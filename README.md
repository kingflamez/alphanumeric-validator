A simple and lightweight utility to check if a given string is alphanumeric. This package returns `true` if the string contains only letters and digits, and `false` otherwise.

## Why Use alphanumeric-validator?

- **Zero dependencies:** Small footprint and quick to install.
- **Straightforward API:** Just one function—no overhead.
- **Tested and Reliable:** Every published version passes CI tests.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install alphanumeric-validator
```

## Usage

Import the function and call it with the string you want to validate:

```javascript
const isAlphaNumeric = require('alphanumeric-validator');

console.log(isAlphaNumeric('abc123')); // true
console.log(isAlphaNumeric('hello world!')); // false
```

It’s that simple. If the string contains only letters (`[a-zA-Z]`) and digits (`[0-9]`), you’ll get `true`; otherwise, `false`.
